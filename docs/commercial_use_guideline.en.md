# **YomiToku Usage Guideline (Supplement to CC BY-NC-SA)**

This guideline provides supplemental clarification for using
**YomiToku OSS** (the “Software”) under the
**CC BY-NC-SA (Non-Commercial + ShareAlike)** license.

This document **does not modify the license terms** themselves.
Its purpose is to clarify the practical boundary between **non-commercial** and **commercial** use.

---

## **1. Permitted Use as Non-Commercial (NC) — Free of Charge**

The following use cases are considered **Non-Commercial (NC)** and
**do not require a commercial license**.

### **1-1. Internal Proof-of-Concept (PoC), Evaluation, and Technical Verification**

* Accuracy evaluation using internal datasets
* Algorithm / model comparison
* Technology assessment not intended for production use
* Internal-only demo creation

---

### **1-2. Academic Research / Educational Use**

* Use within universities, laboratories, and educational institutions
* Use for research papers or academic studies

*However, if the research outputs are used commercially,
a separate commercial agreement is required.*

---

### **1-3. “Unpaid” PoC with External Clients (Important)**

Even when external clients are involved, the use is considered **Non-Commercial (NC)** **only if all** of the following conditions are satisfied:

* **No compensation** (e.g., PoC fees, service fees, development fees) is received from the client
* PoC outputs are **not used in production**
* The client **does not gain business value** (e.g., revenue increase, productivity improvement, cost reduction)
* Deliverables, code, and outputs are **not used commercially**

---

## **2. Activities Considered Commercial Use (Outside NC Scope)**

The following use cases are classified as **commercial use** and
**require a commercial license or a separate agreement**.

### **2-1. Paid PoC Provided to External Clients**

* Receiving PoC fees or service fees
* Offering PoC as a paid package
* Conducting PoC as part of a contracted project

→ Regardless of the label “PoC,” **any monetary compensation constitutes commercial use**.

---

### **2-2. Integration into Production Systems or Business Operations**

* Automating or optimizing internal business workflows
* Integration into RPA or batch-processing pipelines
* Use within long-running internal systems
* Use as part of client-facing products or services

---

### **2-3. Resale, OEM, SaaS, and Secondary Distribution**

* Providing products/services that embed this Software
* Use in SaaS, APIs, or proprietary products
* Incorporating the Software into deliverables provided to clients
* OEM, reseller, or partner distribution models

---

### **2-4. Use in Contracted Development or Consulting Services**

* Use to fulfill client requirements in a contracted project
* Inclusion in deliverables (software, documents, extracted data)
* Use as part of BPO or outsourcing operations

---

### **2-5. Internal Use for Business Efficiency or Cost Reduction**

Internal use does **not** automatically qualify as non-commercial.

* Large-scale document/PDF processing for operational efficiency
* Use for productivity improvement or cost savings
* Embedding in production workflows within the company

→ Such use **directly contributes to business operations** and is therefore commercial.

---

### **2-6. Commercial Use or Distribution of Output Results**

!!!warning
    **Important: Providing Output Results (Outputs) to Third Parties Is Commercial Use**

Providing outputs generated by YomiToku to external parties constitutes
**commercial use**, because it delivers business value created by the Software.

Examples include:

* Providing OCR text to a client
* Including extracted/parsed results in deliverables
* Delivering processed PDFs/CSVs/JSONs to clients
* Using YomiToku outputs as part of SaaS functionality
* Using YomiToku outputs in an RPA pipeline to perform client work
* Providing “documents processed by YomiToku” to any third party

→ If the **outputs** generate business value, it is **commercial use**.

---

## **3. Practical Criteria for Determining Commercial Use**

If any of the following conditions apply, the use is **highly likely to be commercial**:

### ✔ **3-1. Is monetary compensation involved?**

→ If yes, commercial.

### ✔ **3-2. Does the use create business value (revenue or cost reduction)?**

→ If yes, commercial.

### ✔ **3-3. Are outputs delivered to external parties?**

→ Once outputs are provided, it is commercial.
